SIT323-2025-Prac5P: Dockerised Node.js Web Application - This project demonstrates how to containerise a simple Node.js web application using Docker and Docker Compose, as part of SIT323 Task 5.1P. The app is a basic Express-based Node.js application. When started, it displays a simple "Hello World!" message in the browser at localhost:5000. To complete this task, I first cloned the sample app using the command git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample.git and entered the folder with cd node-js-sample. Then I installed dependencies using npm install and tested it locally with npm start, confirming it worked at http://localhost:5000. I then created a Dockerfile with the following content: FROM node:18, WORKDIR /usr/src/app, COPY package*.json ./, RUN npm install, COPY . ., EXPOSE 5000, CMD ["npm", "start"]. After saving the Dockerfile, I built the image with docker build -t my-node-app .. Next, I created a docker-compose.yml file with the configuration: version 3, services: web, build: ., ports: "5000:5000". I used docker-compose up to start the app in a container and confirmed it was running successfully at http://localhost:5000. The application was successfully containerised and run using Docker Compose. All source code, Dockerfile, and configuration files are included in this repository.
